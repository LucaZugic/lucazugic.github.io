	<p id="background"><strong>Background</strong><br>
	Prior to the pursuit of my computer science degree<br>
	I was a neuroscience student and research assistant.<br>
	This has granted me to publish work, win awards, and share my<br>
	knowledge and passion through tutoring and mentoring.<br>
	During this time I worked in a research lab (<a href="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/facilities/sinapse">SINAPSE Lab</a>)<br>
	where I have worked with neuroimaging technologies,<br>
	such as EEG and fNIRS, conducted research work, and<br>
	developed data focused solutions for the lab and others<br>
	in the School of Psychology and Computer Science in<br>
	MATLAB, Python, and Julia.
